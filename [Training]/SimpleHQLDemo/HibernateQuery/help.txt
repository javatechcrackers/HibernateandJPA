diskPersistent="false"
In this example, 
the diskStore property sets the location of the disk cache store.
 Then, the listing declares two caches. 
 The defaultCache element contains the settings for all cached objects that don't have a 
 specific cache element: the number of cached objects held in memory, 
 whether objects in the  cache expire (if eternal is true , then objects don't expire), 
 the number of seconds an object should remain the cache after it was last accessed, 
 the number of seconds an object should remain in the cache after it was created,
  and whether objects exceeding maxElementsInMemory should be spooled to the diskStore.
   Next, for custom settings based on the class, 
   the code defines a cache element with the fully qualified class name listed in the name attribute.
